     <h1>Welcome to my 1st Website!</h1>  
     <p> 
      My name is Erica Vonsha Reid and I am the owner of
      <i>SimpleSweetsbyEVR</i>. I'm currently learning how to create my own website as I'm writing
      this on 10/27/2025. So far, I've learned a lot and I've decided to practice what I've learned and put it in this website. 

      <br>
      <p>
      I want to talk about myself for a minute, I started this
      class Full Stack Web Development in June or July 2024. Since starting this class, I've delayed my learning. I could have been completed by now, but I allowed life to get to me. Life isn't supposed to be easy, its supposed to be challenging, so we can express our experiences to those who struggle the same way we did. I had to drop a life lesson, incase someone needed it. We need each other, because in reality without another human, it would be impossible to connect...ANYWAYS.</p>
      
      I am
      determined to heal from my past traumas. These traumas have prevented me
      from growing and that was a big obstacle in my life. I believe everyone should heal from their past traumas. Life can be so much better. I know a paragraph ago I said life isn't supposed to be easy. It's true, however, easy and better is not the same. Everyone looks at the ultra rich as having a beautiful life because they have so much money, cars, houses, yacths. The world thinks they just travel and have fun. I don't think thats true. I believe they are working on projects we don't understand. I believe most of them are trying to make earth a better place. However, its a challange when lower minded individuals act in anger. Yehoshua ben Yusef said we can be angry, but sin not. This means you can be mad at someone, but don't hurt them.

      Well, baking is my hobby, not a career. I'm interested in working for
      myself, because I really don't like following other people rules when it
      comes to what time I need to be there, what time should I take my lunch,
      and spend useless times in repetitive meetings I don't want to be in. I rather work 2-4 hours a day making $5k a day. Does it sound unrealistic? To you, but not me!
