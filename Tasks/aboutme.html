<h1>Welcome to my 1st Website!</h1>

<p>
  Well, thank you for clicking on the About Me page, that lets me know you want
  to know more about me and I really appreciate that. I grew up in a controlled Baptist home. My mother was strict. I never knew my father. I questioned how he was and what he looked like, but I was given vague answers. Just like every other Christian,  I grew up in
  the church in Detroit, MI. I attended God's Word Baptist
  Church when it was on Oakman blvd and Grand River. Reverend Miller was the pastor there and his preachings were amazing, even though I didn't understand it. 
</p>
<p>
  I used to want to be a Heart Surgeon. I loved the heart. It was too beautiful
  to me. When that plan failed I was lost and confused. I lost my trust in the
  Eternal Father. I lost my Faith in everything and everyone.

  <p>
    How did I lose my faith?
    <ol>
      <li>I lost my mother June 15, 2015.</li>
       <li>I lost my car, my job, and I was living in her home with no electricity.</li> 
       <li>Bedbugs was in the house and we had no idea how they got there.</li>
       <li>I was not able to find a job.</li>
        <li>I ended up losing my mother's house in February 2017.</li>
</ol>
        <p>We ended up moving to Youngstown, OH because a friend of my husband said he had a job for him. The job ended up being a scam that we never took part in. We ended up in a homeless shelter called the Rescue Mission. We stayed there for 6 months and we moved to a townhome that was low income housing. Everything was starting to look up for us. We had 2 cars, our rent was paid up, and I was trading in the stock market. We were doing pretty good, until I became greedy. </p>

There is nothing wrong with wanting to move out the hood to have something better for yourself and your family, but when nothing is threatening your family, why leave? I didn't save any money to move, I didn't have a real plan, I borrowed money and took out personal loans to get to NC. I wanted a 5bdr 3bath home. I changed my mind alot about what I wanted. I was clearly confused.</p>

<p>
  I really didn't know myself. I wanted more from the world, but not more from me. Another turmoil my life was in. We ended up getting a house the spirit of God told me not to get. We were happy, but slowly the house fell apart. We later found out it was a lemon house. The previous owner did a fake home remodel. I was ashamed and I went into a deep depression. I ended up disconnecting myself from reality. BIG MISTAKE! 
</p>

<p>
  WARNING! DO NOT DISCONNECT YOURSELF FROM REALITY!
  I do not mean suicide. This step happens when a person is at their lowest point and the dark voice or the devil is in their mind HEAVY. I imagined me pulling the plug. When I did this, I saw two beings look in my direction, they said, "Hey, what are you doing here? You are not supposed to be here!" They sent me down back to Earth and after that I ended up at the Samiritan Inn.
</p>
<p>
  For the 2nd time in my life, I became homeless again with my family. I couldn't believe I had put my kids through this mess again. While staying at the Samiritan Inn, I've learned alot about myself. I've healed from a lot of my traumas. Especially self sabotage, procrastination, fear, and etc. I cried in group about my pain that I harbored for years. Now, I'm in a place where I ask myself, can I deal with the world on my own again?
</p>

The more I learn, the more I will update this website. <br>
